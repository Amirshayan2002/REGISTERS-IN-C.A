**Introduction to Registers**: Registers are critical components within a computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU). They serve as small storage locations that hold data and instructions currently being executed. Due to their proximity to the CPU, registers provide faster access than memory, making them ideal for storing frequently used variables in a C program. The `register' keyword in C can be used to suggest that a particular variable be stored in a register.

**Types of Registers**: Registers can be broadly classified into three categories: general-purpose registers, special-purpose registers, and user-visible registers. Each type serves a unique function within the CPU's operation.

**Memory Address Register (MAR)**: The MAR is a special-purpose register that holds the address of the memory location to be accessed. It interfaces with the system bus's address lines and specifies the memory address for read or write operations.

**Program Counter (PC)**: The PC is a user-visible register that contains the address of the next instruction to be executed from memory. It plays a crucial role in sequencing and controlling program execution.

**Accumulator Register (AC)**: The AC is a general-purpose register frequently used to store data fetched from memory. It temporarily holds data or the results of an operation during processing cycles.

**Memory Data Register (MDR)**: The MDR is a special-purpose register that contains data to be written into or read out from the addressed memory location. It facilitates the transfer of data to and from immediate access storage.

**Index Register**: The Index Register is a user-visible register used for modifying operand addresses during program execution, typically for vector or array operations. It is particularly useful for iterating through strings and arrays.

**Memory Buffer Register (MBR)**: The MBR, also known as the MDR, is a special-purpose register in the CPU that stores data being transferred to and from immediate access storage. It holds a copy of the value in the memory location specified by the MAR.

**Data Register**: In C programming, the `register' keyword is used to hint to the compiler that a given variable could be stored in a register for faster access. However, the final decision rests with the compiler, which may choose to optimize variable storage based on its algorithms and the program's requirements.

This information should provide a comprehensive understanding of the role and function of registers within a computer system and their relevance in C programming.
